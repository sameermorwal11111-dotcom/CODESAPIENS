❓ TROUBLESHOOTING
================================================================================

Issue: Camera window doesn't open
Fix:
    1. Close all other camera apps
    2. Check camera permissions
    3. Restart VS Code
    4. Try: python run_with_camera_display.py again

Issue: Camera window opens but no image
Fix:
    1. Camera device may be busy
    2. Close all other apps using camera
    3. Restart computer
    4. Try different camera (if multiple cameras available)

Issue: Installation takes long
Fix:
    That's normal! First time takes 2-3 minutes.
    Just wait. It only happens once.

Issue: Face not detected (no yellow box)
Fix:
    1. Improve lighting (move to brighter area)
    2. Get closer to camera (30-60cm)
    3. Clear face view (no sunglasses/hat)
    4. Try facing camera directly

Issue: Shows "NO MATCH" during recognition
Fix:
    1. Same lighting as during capture
    2. Same distance from camera as capture
    3. Clear face view
    4. Move closer to camera
    5. Run option 4 again

Issue: Module/Package errors
Fix:
    1. Just run: python run_with_camera_display.py again

💡 TIPS & TRICKS
================================================================================

Better Recognition:
    ✓ Good lighting during capture
    ✓ Same lighting during recognition
    ✓ Clear face view (no obstruction)
    ✓ Face 30-60cm from camera
    ✓ Facing camera directly

Multiple People:
    ✓ Run option 4 multiple times
    ✓ Different name each time
    ✓ Creates separate models for each person

Improve Accuracy:
    ✓ Capture in good lighting
    ✓ Vary angles slightly (look left/right)
    ✓ Different expressions (smile, neutral)
    ✓ Use option 1 to add more images later

Debugging:
    ✓ Watch progress on camera feed
    ✓ See green boxes = faces detected
    ✓ See yellow boxes = capturing in progress
    ✓ See red/green boxes = recognition happening
